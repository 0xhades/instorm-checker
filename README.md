# instorm
instagram checker written in go language.
special thanks for: github.com/mpg25 and github.com/fatih

# installation
```
git clone github.com/justghostz/instorm.git ~/go/src/instorm
```
# libraries
```
go get github.com/fatih/color
go get github.com/google/uuid
```
# run
```
go run instorm
```
# build
```
go build instorm
```

the reason i put clients.txt, because if you tried to go to a user profile,
with www.instagram.com/example/?__a=1 parameter you can't, until you logged in by a instagram account.
